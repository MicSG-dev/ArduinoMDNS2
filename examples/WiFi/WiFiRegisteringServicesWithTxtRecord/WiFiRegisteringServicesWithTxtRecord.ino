  // Now let's register the service we're offering (a web service) via Bonjour!
  // To do so, we call the addServiceRecord() method. The first argument is the
  // name of our service instance and its type, separated by a dot. In this
  // case, the service type is _http. There are many other service types, use
  // Google to look up some common ones, but you can also invent your own
  // service type, like _mycoolservice - As long as your clients know what to
  // look for, you're good to go.
  // The second argument is the port on which the service is running. This is
  // port 80 here, the standard HTTP port.
  // The last argument is the protocol type of the service, either TCP or UDP.
  // Of course, our service is a TCP service.
  // With the service registered, it will show up in a mDNA/Bonjour-enabled web
  // browser. As an example, if you are using Apple's Safari, you will now see
  // the service under Bookmarks -> Bonjour (Provided that you have enabled
  // Bonjour in the "Bookmarks" preferences in Safari).

  // Now we'll register a second service record: This time, we specify a TXT
  // content as well, in order to point to a specific page on our server.
  // This is just an example to show that the mDNS library supports TXT
  // records as well, but I won't go into detail about how they work. Check
  // out http://www.zeroconf.org/Rendezvous/txtrecords.html for an excellent
  // primer.
  // What this does is that your browser will now show a second mDNS entry,
  // which will take you to another page on the Arduino web server.
